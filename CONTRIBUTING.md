### Trust

Because joining the team means gaining access to protected resources, trust is essential. We judge trustworthiness through the following manners:

 * Having an established relationship with either the Fullstaq Ruby project, or the wider Ruby community. The longer the better.
 * A contractual relationship (such as employment) with [Fullstaq B.V.](https://fullstaq.com/). Contractual relationships carry legal weight and provide greater likelihood of a stable trust relationship; at a minimum they establish strong legal accountability.
